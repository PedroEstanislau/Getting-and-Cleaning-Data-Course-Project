####Introduction

This repository contains the R code for the course project of the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The purpose of this project is to show the collection, work with, and cleaning of this data set. The final result, tidy data, has been prepared to be used  in late analysis.

####Input Data Set

The input data set("Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones") has been taken from UCI.

####Execution and files

The input data Set has been saved/stored in UCI HAR Dataset(directory).

The file CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the steps that ware made to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script used to load,clean and create the tidy data.
The R file does not receive any type of arguments, and in order to work need to have in the same directory the uncompress information about the  UCI HAR Dataset.

The result of the execution is store in the smae location of  the run_analysis.R.
The tidy data file calls course-project-tidy-data.txt.
